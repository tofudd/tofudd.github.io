After many troubles I've finally finished Lanchat 2. 
Lanchat 2 uses .NET 5 instead Node.js. 
The biggest change is that it doesn't need a central server. 
Users are connected directly. 
Messages are encrypted with RSA and AES.  

## Lanchat 1.x

Original Lanchat was written in node.js. It uses Socket.io library. 
No longer being developed but is pretty stable.  
Download [big exe bundle with node.js](https://github.com/tofudd/lanchat/releases/tag/1.1.0)
 or get `lanchat-npm` package from NPM.
